# Constraints

## 1. Time

 Our back-end has a fixed timeline of  weeks, starting on April 02, 2023, and ending on April 16, 2023. This means that we need to prioritize our tasks and work efficiently to meet our deadlines.

## 2. Technical

 Our project is limited by the technical skills and knowledge of our team members. We need to ensure that we are using the appropriate technologies and tools that we are comfortable with to build the app.

**Note!**

By using these Firebase elements or tools, we can build a robust and scalable lendout web app that can handle multiple users.

## 3. Data constraints

 we have to include specific constraints related to the data that our app backend will handle, such as maximum data size, data formats, or data validation rules.

### a. Maximum data size

We limit the size of the data that can be stored in your backend to ensure that it can be processed efficiently. For example, we will limit the creation on items.

### b. Data formats

We will  specify the data formats that our app backend can handle to ensure that the data is consistent and can be processed correctly.

### c. Data validation rules

We may establish rules for validating the data that is input into the app to ensure that it is accurate and consistent. For example, you may require that users provide a valid email address or phone number before they can create an account.

### d. User limit

The maximum number of users is 20, you may want to set a constraint in our app backend that will prevent new user accounts from being created once the limit has been reached.
