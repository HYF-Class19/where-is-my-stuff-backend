# Communication Plan

- Weekly team meetings: Schedule a weekly team meeting to discuss the progress of the project, any issues or concerns, and upcoming tasks.
- Slack channel: for the team to communicate and collaborate on the project. This can be used for quick updates, questions, and sharing files.
- Zoom Meeting: for the team to discuss about project process and share new ideas
- Project management tool: Use a project management tool such as [GitHub project]() tool to assign tasks, track progress, and set deadlines. This will help keep everyone on the same task and ensure tasks are completed on time.
- Google Drive updates: post or upload regular files and docs updates to the team to summarize progress and highlight any upcoming deadlines or important information, [The google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n4xAEPq0uNc7XVgn6ZWWloANV89NJ89Z).
- Coaches meetings: Schedule regular meetings with the Coaches to provide updates on the project and gather feedback. These can be in-person or virtual depending on the coach's availability and preference.
- Change management process: Establish a change management process to handle any changes or revisions to the project scope or timeline. This should include a clear process for requesting, reviewing, and approving changes.
